Travis Tricks
=============

This repo is a place to experiment with what travis-ci will do
under various odd circumstances, for exploration and
understanding.  It specifically stands apart from other, more real
repos, so that my experiments don't affect live, actual
development workflows.

In other words: nothing to see here, move along please...
